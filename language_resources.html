	  <h2 id="fluent_forever"><em>Fluent Forever</em> By Gabriel Wyner</h2>
	  <img src="https://4boz9c1xneye2wh6s235261r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fluent-Forever-book.gif" width="328" height="230" alt="fluentforever" id="fluentforever">
	  <p>This was one of the first books that I read about foreign language learning and it was by far one of the best books that I have ever read on the subject. The premise of the book is that one can streamline their memory by using something called <strong>"Spaced Repetition"</strong> in memory. Our brain naturally forgets things over time and if you were to plot our forgetfulness with time, you would find that any new information that is learned already begins leaving our heads after a few minutes. Give it a few days or weeks and the information is completely gone if not properly reinforced. Thus, the whole science behind this memory technique is in the use of Spaced Repetition Software programs that are designed to remind you of a piece of information when it is scientifically predicted that you are about to forget it. The research shows that when people are reminded right when they are about to forget, it cements the information into their long term memory over several cycles. The book talks all about how to utilize flashcard programs to take advantage of this technique. Additionally, the author explains various strategies such as the use of mnemonics to remember words and phrases. Thus, his language philosophy can be summed up into three things: 1. No translation, 2. Learn the pronunciation first and foremost, 3. Learn using a method that helps you remember things rapidly. Here is a video of the author himself who has successfully learned German, French, Italian, Russian, Hungarian, and is at a B2 level in Japanese.

	  <p>The Teach Yourself series has always been one of the standard beginner level language learning texts on the market. The product consists of a book of dialogs, short grammar explanations, and exercises with accompanying audio files. This book is basically just the standard way of learning foreign languages like you do at school except that the dialogs do not usually come with translations. Thus, one ends up assimilating the gist of the sentences and words without getting too bogged down by word for word translations (word for word translations are by far one of the worst ways to learn foreign languages. <strong>If there is one tip I can give, it is to think of a language in phrases rather than individual words</strong>). This is a good book to go through when you first start out a language to get a rundown of the basics, but I recommend not doing any of the exercises at all. Grammar drills, in my opinion, pale in comparison to actual speaking practice and reading practice with native speakers and texts. You assimilate all the grammar you need if you read a lot of content that interests you.

	  <br/>
	  <p>The Assimil series is popular in Europe and is not as widely available here in America. What makes this series stand out from others is that it is basically just a textbook of dialogs. There are minimal grammar explanations and one learns the language solely by bilingual texts. What this means is that there is a dialog in a foreign language and an equivalent English translation on the next page.
	    <br/>
	    <br/>

	    <br/>
 This strategy of utilizing bilingual texts is useful because it allows you to focus on the meaning and similarities between language syntax and grammar without getting bogged down on declension tables and grammar rules. <strong>Syntax comparison</strong> is a great strategy for understanding word order and how a language's sentences are structured. Another strategy this series employs is <strong> bidirectional translation</strong>. This technique involves translating a text written in a foreign language into your native tongue. The main difference from other standard learning methods is the requirement to translate your translation back into your target language. You thus make two translations - one initial translation from the foreign language into your native language, and then a translation from the native language back into the foreign language. It is this last step that really cements grammar constructs and vocabulary into your head because you are actively using it to reproduce a text. The method itself is used by famous language learners like Luca Lampariello who has learned about 10-12 languages fluently. Here is a video of him!

	  <p>One of my favorite apps is a website developed by polyglot Steve Kaufman who has learned about 14 different languages to varying degrees. His website is predominantly a reading website where you can read from a fairly large library of native content in dozens of languages. Each article of reading comes with audio so that you can <strong>listen while reading along</strong>, another great learning strategy. The one thing that distringuishes it for me is the way the website works. Progress is based on word count (ie. how many words you know). In language learning, one of the most important things is vocabulary. If you do not have the words, you cannot speak, write, read, or understand anything. Thus, vocabulary is an easily measurable metric for language learning progress. Additionally, the website works in that every new article will have new words that you have never encountered before. For each word you do not know, it is highlighed in blue. When you get to it, you choose a definition of the word based on a variety of online dictionaries and the word turns from blue to yellow. Yellow is the color code for "yes, you have seen this word before." The cool thing is that these words stay yellow (until you retire them), even in other texts. Thus, when you finish one article and move to another, any yellow words you see in this new article were previously seen when you were reading other articles. This reminder that you have seen the words or phrases before adds positive reinforcement and helps you keep these words and phrases in long term memory. Here is a video on how LingQ works from the founder of LingQ, Steve Kaufman himself.

	  <img src="https://glossika.com/img/site/home-og-image.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="glossika_logo" id="glossika_logo">
	  <p>The Glossika series is available in dozens of languages in three levels. The interesting thing about this product is that it utilizes the strategy of <strong>sentence mining</strong>. The whole premise behind this strategy is that if one finds and learns 10,000+ sentences in their target language, they will learn all the syntax and grammar that is needed and will end up learning slang and different ways to say things to the point that they will become fluent. Glossika itself is a booklet of sentences, 3000 sentences to be exact. The program focuses not only on reading and speaking, but also has a heavy focus on the <strong>dictation</strong> method of improving listening skills. You basically listen over and over to an audio recording and write each and every word you hear. Since these are presented in sentences, dictation happens much faster and you progress faster than if you used dictation on large articles or audiobooks. Overall, these 3000 sentences start simple and as you move through to Volume 3, the sentences are all at a pretty high level and would make these more challenging to remember.

	  <p>This is the application that Gabriel Wyner talks about in his book, Fluent Forever (mentioned above). It is one of the best SRS (Spaced Repetition System) flashcard apps. This application is basically a platform where you can build flashcards and review them based on the SRS principles. The application does all of the work for you and all you have to do is review everyday. The program allows you to set how many new cards you would like to learn everyday and based on how you do, you will have cards to review every day based on when the program calculates you might forget the cards. Whenever you see a card, you try to remember the contents on the other side and based on whether you were right or wrong, you tell the app whether you forgot completely, whether it was hard remembering it, whether memory of the card was good, or whether you knew the card without any effort at all. Based on your responses, the app prioritizes cards and sets certain review timeframes where it does not show you these cards again until the timeframe has passed. These timeframes correspond to advanced algorithmic calculations based on your responses as to when you will likely be at the point of forgetting the contents. I have personally used this application and have learned about 300-400 German words in the span of about a month. SRS is revolutionary to say the least. I am planning to use SRS to remember programming language syntax!

<!--FluentU and Yabla-->
	<div class="text_border">
	  <h2 id="fluentu_yabla_videos">FluentU/Yabla</h2>
	  <p>When learning a foreign language, there is nothing better than learning through exposure to foreign content. The authenticity and level of this foreign content is leagues better than the forced and non-lifelike conversations that are present in more traditional textbooks where the words you learn are related to certain topics that you won't end up using in most beginner conversations. The best way to rapidly learn a language is to learn the words that natives use most frequently, and that can be accomplished through exposure to native content. Yabla and FluentU are essentially very similar applications that allow the user to view media and Youtube Videos from across the world. The system then takes these multimedia files and adds captions and learning tools to them so that the user ends up learning a foreign language by watching videos and conversations by native speakers or even through foreign television commercials.

	  <img src="https://www.rypeapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/italki.png" width="400" height="225" alt="italki_logo" id="italki_logo">
	  <p>This is one of the best websites to get speaking practice as there is a whole community of both instructors and language exchange partners. All meetings done through iTalki typically utilize the Skype application since you will be communicating with people that live in foreign countries where your target language is spoken. Additionally, tutors typically have a curriculum designed in order to teach foreign languages over Skype. People typically find community tutors as they are not too expensive and they can speak and practice the foreign language with you for the full time rather than having to split half and half (half in your native language and half in your partner's language) like in most language exchanges. On iTalki, there are three different tiers. The first tier is language exchange partners. These are usually hard to find because most people live busy lives and speaking is usually not a consistently planned out event each week. If you are able to find someone that can speak regularly, you will be able to practice speaking for free! The next level up includes community tutors that you pay a small amount of money to in order to speak with them in 100% the language you are trying to learn. These community tutors help out with speaking for the most part and may not know as much about the grammatical syntax. These community tutors tend to be pretty cheap running at around 5-8 dollars an hour. Finally, the last tier are actual tutors and teachers that use the website to run a business of teaching foreign languages. These teachers tend to have full curriculums planned out over Skype and tend to cost much more (but still way more affordable than in-person tutors).

<!--Native Content-->
	<div class="text_border">
	  <h2 id="authentic_content">Authentic Native Content</h2>
	  <p>Last but not least, the best content to learn from after you get past the beginner stage is native content. When you finish a beginner's course, begin gradually exposing yourself to harder and harder content until you get to natural native content that is made for native speakers of the language. This can include Youtube videos, movies, television shows, music, news outlets from the foreign country, blogs, native podcasts, talkshows, textbooks, literature (for example, the French equivalent of classics authors like Ernest Hemingway might be Victor Hugo who is the author of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Les Miserables), and basically anything that residents of foreign countries hear and read on a daily basis. By the time you can understand these resources, you are likely at a pretty good level in the language that learning just becomes natural and not as much effort has to be put into it. The best way to save time when learning a foreign language is to find something you normally like to do in English (reading, watching TV, watching news, watching movies, etc) and doing it in the foreign language you are learning instead. You still enjoy doing it, so it does not feel like work because you are still doing what you like to do.
