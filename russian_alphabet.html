	<div id="introduction">
	  <p>One of my favorite alphabets/scripts is the Russian script. My favorite letters have got to be "zhe" (<strong>&#1046;</strong>) followed by "de" (<strong>&#1044;</strong>). I have always thought that Russian letters looked pretty cool and that they somehow just visually fit together in words. The added benefit of learning how to read in Russian is that words are typically pronounced exactly the way they are spelled. There are sound rules with certain combinations of letters and some sounds change based on where the stress in the word is, but it is always consistent. The first step is to learn the letters, and that is just what I hope to teach on this webpage. There are a few main obstacles with the Russian alphabet including letters that look like English letters but are pronounced differently as well as letters that make sounds that we do not have in English. There are 33 letters used in the Russian language that do not encompass all of the Cyrillic script. Some letters that are used in Serbian, Bulgarian, and other Slavic languages are not present in Russian! I have placed the sections in the order that I learned them - ie. tackling them from easiest letters to hardest letters. Good luck!

	  <p>I will start out with the easiest letters to learn in Russian. There is a group of Russian letters that look and sound exactly like letters in English.</p>

<!--I gave each and every letter a <span> tag so that I could manipulate the letters and had a reference class of letter to change all the letters with one CSS entry.-->

            <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1040;&#1072;</strong></span> - This letter looks and sounds like the letter "A" in English. It is pronounced "ah" like the "a" in f<strong>a</strong>r.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1045;&#1077;</strong></span> - This letter looks and sounds similar to an English "E". It is pronounced "e" like in <strong>e</strong>xit or like the "ye" in <strong>ye</strong>ti.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1050;&#1082;</strong></span> - This letter looks and sounds like the letter "K" in English. It is prounounced "ka" like in <strong>k</strong>ettle or <strong>c</strong>at.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1052;&#1084;</strong></span> - This letter sounds like the letter "M" in English. It is pronounced "em" like in <strong>m</strong>elt or <strong>m</strong>an.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1054;&#1086;</strong></span> - This letter sounds like the letter "O" in English. It is pronounced "o" like in n<strong>o</strong>t.

	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1058;&#1090;</strong></span> - This letter sounds like the letter "T" in English. It is pronounced "te" like in <strong>t</strong>able.

	  <h2 id="greek_letters">Russian Letters that Agree With Greek Letters</h2>
	  <p>There are a handful of letters in the Russian language that look and sound like their counterparts in the Greek language. The letters for "Alpha (A)", "Epsilon (E)", "Mu (M)", "Tau (T)", "Kappa (K)", and "Omicron (O)" (<strong>every letter in the section above</strong>) fall into this category as well, but were separated in reference to English. It only goes to show how related the Greek and Latin alphabets actually are to one another. There are letters that look like Greek letters, but are not pronounced the same way. I am putting only those letters that look and sound like Greek into this category.
	  </p>
	  <hr/>
	  <div id="greek_block">
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1043;&#1075;</strong></span> - This letter looks and sounds like the Greek letter "Gamma". It is pronounced "ge" like in the English word <strong>g</strong>ame.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1055;&#1087;</strong></span> - This letter looks and sounds like the Greek letter "Pi". It is pronounced "pe" like in the English word <strong>p</strong>artition.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1056;&#1088;</strong></span> - This letter looks like both the English letter "P" and the Greek letter "Rho". From experience, I do not think of it like the letter "P" because it is not pronounced like the English letter "P". It is actually pronounced like "Rho" in that it sounds like "re" as in <strong>r</strong>ock, but the "r" is tongue rolled like in Spanish.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1060;&#1092;</strong></span> - This letter looks and is pronounced like the letter "Phi" in Greek. It is called "ef" and is pronounced like the "f" in <strong>f</strong>ood or the "ph" in <strong>ph</strong>araoh.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1061;&#1093;</strong></span> - This letter looks like the English letter "X" and the Greek letter "Chi". This should be thought of as sounding like the Greek letter as it sounds like "kha" like in the Scottish word lo<strong>ch</strong> like a strong German "ch". The sound is a guttural throat sound.

	  <p>There are a handful of tricky Russian letters that look like letters or numbers that we know, but that are pronounced differently. These will probably be the hardest to learn because of this, but I have faith in you!

	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1042;&#1074;</strong></span> - This letter looks like the English letter "B" but is actually pronounced "ve" like in the word <strong>v</strong>anquish.

	  <h2 id="different_letters">Russian Letters that Do Not Look Like Things We Know</h2>
	  <p>There are several letters in Russian that do not resemble anything in the Greek or English languages. These letters are unique to the Cyrillic script. There are no hints in terms of appearance as to what they sound like.
	  </p>
	  <hr/>
	  <div id="different_block">
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1041;&#1073;</strong></span> - This letter sounds like the letter "B" in English like in the word <strong>b</strong>rain.

	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1044;&#1076;</strong></span> - This letter sounds like the letter "D" in English like in my name <strong>D</strong>erek!
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1046;&#1078;</strong></span> - This letter sounds like "Zh" and makes a "zhe" sound like the "s" makes in the word plea<strong>s</strong>ure.

	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1048;&#1080;</strong></span> - This letter makes an "ee" sound like in the word m<strong>ee</strong>t.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1049;&#1081;</strong></span> - This letter makes a shorter "ee" sound than the previous letter. Think about cutting the y sound in bo<strong>y</strong> short.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1067;&#1099;</strong></span> - This letter is, in my opinion, the hardest one to pronounce in Russian. It is pronounced sort of like an "ih" where the "h" signifies a more open sounding "i". It is similar to the "i" in <strong>i</strong>ll, but with the back of your tongue touching the back of your mouth.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1051;&#1083;</strong></span> - This letter sounds like the English letter "L" and makes a "le" sound like in the word <strong>l</strong>uck.

	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1062;&#1094;</strong></span> - This letter makes a "tse" sound like in the word boo<strong>ts</strong>.

	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1064;&#1096;</strong></span> - This letter sounds like an "Sh" and makes a "sha" sound like in the word <strong>sh</strong>are.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1065;&#1097;</strong></span> - This letter is a rougher version of the previous letter. It makes a "shcha" sound like if you combined the "sh" and "ch" in tra<strong>sh_ch</strong>amber.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1069;&#1101;</strong></span> - This letter is pronounced with an "e" sound like in the word <strong>e</strong>nd.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1070;&#1102;</strong></span> - This letter is pronounced with a "yoo" sound like in the word, well, <strong>you</strong>.

	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1071;&#1103;</strong></span> - This letter looks like a backwards "R" and is pronounced with a "ya" sound like in the word <strong>ya</strong>rn.

	  <h2 id="hardsoft">Russian Letters that Indicate Soft or Hard Consonants</h2>
	  <p>In Russian, there are hard and soft consonant sounds when you pronounce words. The distinction between soft and hard consonants in Russian is difficult, but we sort of do this already in English. For example, in the word "moot" the "m" is pronounced as a hard consonant while in the word "mute" the "m" is pronounced as a soft consonant. In Russian, hard consonants are pronounced with the back portion of your tongue touching the back portion of your mouth. Soft consonants are palatalized meaning that the middle of your tongue touches the middle of the roof of your mouth. (I know it's confusing...this is the hardest part of learning to pronounce things in Russian. The letters are straightforward though!)
	  </p>
	  <hr/>

	  <div id="softhard_block">
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1066;&#1098;</strong></span> - This letter signifies a hard consonant pronunciation. Consonants that have this letter immediately following it are pronounced hard.
	    </p>
	    <p><span class="letter"><strong>&#1068;&#1100;</strong></span> - This letter signifies a soft consonant pronunciation. Consonants that have this letter immediately following it are pronounced soft.

	  <h2>Russian Cursive (In Case This Wasn't Hard Enough)</h2>
	  <p>You've learned the Russian alphabet! Now what? Well, you might be <strong>GLAD</strong> (sarcasm) to learn that when Russians write things by hand, their writing rarely resembles the printed text. That's right, they write in cursive! In English, we usually write words the way they are typed and use cursive only as a formality; unfortunately for us, Russians rarely write the way they type...In order to be able to read Russian that is handwritten, you need to be able to read cursive. Here is a helpful video.
