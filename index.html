<!--My style is of rectangular containers that hold various sections of text. Thus, I enclosed sections of text in a div container. These div containers will be modified in CSS to achieve the desired effect. Additionally, all text div containers will contain the same class name so that I can create the desired effect with one CSS entry.-->

	  <h2 id="introduction">An Introduction</h2>
	  <p>Hi, my name is Derek. One of my greatest hobbies is learning foreign languages. I have always been fascinated by different cultures and how people communicate the same ideas using different words, syntax, sounds, and grammar. Since I was trying to find a topic to create my website about, I figured that I would give you all some information about something that I find very interesting: alphabets (and language learning in general). How did so many different alphabets develop? How are they related? Why do some countries use pictograms instead of letters? 
	  </p>

	  <h3>What is an Alphabet?</h3>
	  <p>When language and alphabets are concerned, one cannot help but to notice that the earliest humans had an extremely difficult challenge to overcome: To represent the world around them using some sort of medium for documentation.  These representations consisted of individual, discrete units that would be put together in certain patterns to represent ideas and messages. When you think about it, these mediums did not just have to be alphabets or writing systems; in fact, a system of writing was only <b>ONE</b> of these mediums. Others included art and music. Alphabets were useful to the earliest humans because of their ability to document information, and not just instructions or words, but actual feelings and conceptual ideas. And that is what an alphabet actually is. It is a medium through which we are able to document ideas and experiences that could be read and interpreted in a similar way between members of our species. Not only that, but an alphabet even contains historical information on the origins of certain groups of people. It is amazing to recognize that two modern languages that are completely different in sound and grammar, like Greek and Russian for example, actually have the exact same letters for a large portion of their writing system. When you think about how our own Latin alphabet was derived from Greek, you realize that Russian and Latin, at least in their respective writing systems, are actually related.

<!--This block was dedicated to making a sort of alphabet explorer with various alphabet systems in images. I am planning to have the mouseover action cause a map to replace alphabet image. This map will be an example of where the alphabet is used. Thus, each image got its own <div> container with a unique id (will allow me to change both the class and the src). The "src" property will be changed to an image of a map on the mouseover action. Thus, each container definitely needs its own id.-->

	  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8b/ca/6f/8bca6fc4f397f9c399304ad5d5c95782.jpg" alt="hieroglyphs" width="300" height="191" id="hieroglyphics"/> 
	  <p>The earliest occurrences of  alphabets are believed to have originated in Ancient Egypt with their use of hieroglyphics in governmental, fiscal, and religious circumstances. These early writing systems were actually only known by a handful of scribes and writers; for good measure too, because hieroglyphics contained some 1,500 different symbols that represented both words and sounds. The difference between the two was that the word symbols represented a series of sounds while the sound symbols represent individual units of sound. In most alphabets today, we use predominantly sound symbols to spell words and have largely ditched the word symbols with the exception of a few countries. Imagine having to deal with both! That would be like combining Chinese and Russian together into sentences! Yikes! Additionally, there were some 150 sound signs in the early Egyptian language, about 33 of which represented distinct consonant sounds. Some of the other symbols produced the same sounds but in different contexts. Likewise, other symbols represented syllabic sounds like "ba", "ka", "po", and others. The catch was that vowels were often not written in these words. For example, if I were to write the name of an animal, it would be "lphnt" and the "e" and the "a" locations would be inferred based on context of the consonants. What word do you think that was? If you have ever learned Arabic, Hebrew, or derivatives of these languages, you know that part of the difficulty with learning them is their distinct lack of written-in vowels. You literally have to know how the word is pronounced in context to be able to accurately read it. The similarities with early Egyptian writing suggests that this is where this quality stemmed from. It was not until writing became more widespread in use that modifications and evolution began taking place.

	  <p>Having their main civilization set up around the Nile River, many crops like papyrus were grown by farmers. Strips of this crop could be soaked, weaved together, and be allowed to dry which resulted in an early form of paper. The main benefit of this material was its portability. It was nearly weightless compared to the typical tablets and stone that were used. Portability led to increased accessibility and the first signs of evolution took place with the development of a writing system that was suited for rapid writing (like cursive) and increased efficiency. Many of the word symbols and sound symbols used in the earliest hieroglyphics were eliminated to facilitate efficiency in text. Additionally, papyrus allowed the writing system to leave Egypt for the first time and this more efficient system spread out. One of the most significant discoveries of the history of alphabets dated to about 1700 BC where inscriptions written in a Sinai language showed that humans had completely eliminated word symbols and used only consonant sounds to form words. This was the earliest sign of the development of alphabets based off of sound systems alone.

	  <h2>Modern Alphabet Families and Their Similarities</h2>
	  <p>The most well-known ancestor of modern alphabet would probably be from the Phoenician people, a group of merchants that dated back to the 16th century BC.  They developed a writing system that used sound symbols alone; not only that, but they now wrote out their vowels! Additionally, they were the pioneers of giving the letter a set of  mnemonic names to help people remember how to pronounce the sounds that were represented by each letter. Thus, the Phoenician name "aleph" for a letter that closely resembles our letter "A" was a mnemonic that would help users remember that that symbol was pronounced with the same "ah" as the first part of the letter's name. Likewise, "beth" which closely resembled our letter "B" reminded users to produce a "buh" sound. With these standard sounds, another innovative aspect of the Phoenician alphabet was that these sounds were nearly all universal and could be adopted, with different tones and accents, to a variety of different languages. Thus, many modern languages share the same sounds like "ah", "ee", "oh", "oo", and a similar set of consonants. Some languages adopted guttural sounds using the throat while others adopted tongue rolled sounds. Still yet, some African languages even adopted clicking noises with the tongue while some Asian languages even have rising and sinking intonation in some of these sounds. 
	  </p>

	  <p>Thus it is believed that the Phoenician alphabet formed the basis for the majority of world languages to date. Two main branches came out of this alphabet: Aramaic and Greek. The Aramaic sector eventually branched out into most of the Eastern languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Tamil, Bengali, Thai, Indonesian, Tibetan and many others. The Greek sector branched out into many of our Western languages like Russian, Latin, French, Spanish, English, and even Armenian and Georgian. Gradually, these languages and people added their own letters and sounds to these languages and the diversity and uniquess of languages as we know them today were born. The following image shows the evolution from Phoenician to modern day Roman/Latin alphabets and the European additions that were added in languages like French, German, and Portuguese. <strong>Click on the image for a complete alphabet family tree that summarizes this whole webpage!</strong>

	  <p>Thus, in conclusion, modern day alphabet appears to have been a result of the need to document ideas and information by containing them in symbols and ultimately attempting to find ways to speed up and optimize the transfer of this information.</p>

	  <h3>What About Chinese, Japanese, and Other Pictographic Languages?</h3>
	  <p>Though Ancient Egyptian and Chinese writing systems had similarities, archaeologists believe that these two languages actually developed independently. It is not entirely agreed upon how the Chinese writing system was invented, but the first evidence of full sentences was found on oracle bones that were used by diviners to tell the future. These bones were written on and heated. Cracks would form and would be interpreted to tell the future. Many researchers agree that Chinese writing started out as pictures that represented the objects they illustrated, but eventually came to represent the <i>words</i> of these objects. However, it is not known when these linguistic features were gained. Chinese is unique in that, just like in old Egyptian, the system took advantage of combining symbols with a set of determinatives that would give hints on the meanings of words. Today, we know of these as radicals, or smaller symbols that, when combined, form larger words. It is believed that these radicals gave rise to the added complexity of the language and the increasingly linear visual appearance that it evolved into. And just like Egyptian hieratics began circulating around, the Chinese language was spread and can be notably seen as influences on Japanese and even Korean. The Japanese used to write in all Chinese words and gradually adopted two other writing systems known as Kana (Hiragana and Katakana) which were phonetic and pronunciation aids originating from old Chinese  literature and Chinese Buddhist scriptures. The Japanese have three writing systems, two phonetic, and one pictographic (Kanji is basically just Chinese characters). Even the Koreans used to write in Chinese characters until they adopted their current phonetic alphabet (Hangul).

	  <p> Overall, I have always used the word for pineapple as evidence for the developmental independence between Chinese and the rest of the languages that stemmed from Phoenician. See the image below:
	  </p>
	  <img id="pineapple" src="https://2static2.fjcdn.com/comments/Except+in+the+english+language+they+are+called+ananas+_b3f4892b48e7297aff9700281562aadc.jpg" alt="pineapple_picture" width="500" height="454"/><br/>

	  <p>"Ananas" or some derivative of that word is used to describe a certain tropical fruit; with the exception of English, which is weird, and calls it "pineapple" for some reason.  However, in Chinese, it is called "bo1 luo2"(The 1 represents a neutral tone and the 2 represents a rising tone. The word is completely different from "ananas"), in Japanese it is called "painappuru" (which actually sounds a lot like "pineapple" in English signifying an English lone word), and in Korean it is called "pain-aepeul" which sounds like an English lone word as well. Even languages that seem so far removed from English have actually evolved through global exposure to include loan words from English. This is what makes languages so amazing: they are constantly evolving entities, even today!
